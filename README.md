Summary
Strong scientific research and project management skills, as evidenced by the development of 2 novel characterization devices, which has lead to over $395K in NSF funding renewal.
Product and market knowledge in the fields of Electron-Optics, Material Science and Nano-Science, including commercial characterization instrumentation,  device fabrication equipment, and thin film deposition systems. This has contributed to the co-authoring of 4 scientific articles (two published in peer-reviewed journals & two under review)
Effective communication skills, with experience in giving the oral presentations of research findings in front both cross-discipline and expert audiences in weekly group meetings, 7 local and national conferences and 1 invited talk at an international conference.
Recent Work Experience
Adjunct Assistant Professor and Visiting Scholar                                             June 2018 - Present University of Cincinnati Physics Department                                                                                                                  	
Dedicated organization skills, as shown by the construction of an automated coherent optical metrology system, resulting in the construction of an ultrafast (<95fs) thin film optical characterization device.
Conscientious information and people management skills, as evidenced by the teaching of practical elementary physics concepts online to  70+ students, managing course material, mentoring students, and grading.
	
Graduate Research Assistant and Research Consultant	                      January 2013 - March 2018  University of Nebraska-Lincoln Physics Department	
Experienced problem solver, strong scientific research and project management skills, with an expertise in electron optics and material science (electronics), as evidenced by the development of 2 novel Electro-Optical devices leading to the co-authoring of 4 scientific articles (two published in peer-reviewed publications & two under review).
Knowledgeable innovator, as demonstrated by the development of two new computational methods to model and measure coherence, dephasing, and entropy in optical systems. This has lead to $395K in NSF funding renewal.
Computational data analysis skills, including applied scientific modeling and programming skills, such as the design and implementation of algorithms; and the processing, execution, and analysis of 5GB+ synthetic and empirical data.

Teaching Assistant                                                                           August 2011-December 2014 University of Nebraska-Lincoln Physics Department
Responsible mentoring skills including training, lecturing, grading and designing of lesson plans for both undergraduate labs and recitations for 250+ students over 8 semesters. 
Undergraduate Research Assistant  	                                                     May 2010 - June 2011 Stony Brook University Department of Physics and Astronomy
